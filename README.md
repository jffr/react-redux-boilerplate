# React Redux Boilerplate
_Yet another React Redux boilerplate, but we all use CRA anyways!_ ðŸŽ‰

This boilerplate came to life when I learning about Webpack and React Redux with TypeScript. If you're interested, it has the following features:
* TypeScript
* CSS Modules
* Hot Module Reloading
* Lazy loading components
* Linter for React and Typescript (ESLint)
* Redux with TypeScript
* Plugin to notify you about avoidable re-renders (@welldone-software/why-did-you-render)
* An overengineerd counter application to get you started!

## Usage

To start the development server, use `npm start` in your favorite terminal. You can build your app for production with `npm run build`.
